# CHANGELOG


## [0.1.1] - 2025-07-22
### Changed
- Improved the `Create Content` node System Message.  Anthropic is not as flexible with the structured output parser as OpenAI is so it sometimes fails and needs to be re-run.  System Message should be further improved to deal with this edge case.


## [0.1.0] - 2025-07-22
### Added
- Beginning a new project.
